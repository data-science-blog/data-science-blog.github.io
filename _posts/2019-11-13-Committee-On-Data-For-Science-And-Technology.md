The Committee on [Data](https://data-science-blog.github.io/Big-Data) for Science and Technology (CODATA) was established in 1966 as an interdisciplinary committee of the International Council for Science. It seeks to improve the compilation, critical evaluation, storage, and retrieval of [data](https://data-science-blog.github.io/Data) of importance to science and technology. CODATA sponsors the CODATA international conferenceevery two years. CODATA is best known for (and sometimes confused with) its Task Group on Fundamental Constants (TGFC). Established in 1969, its purpose is to periodically provide the international scientific and technological communities with an internationally accepted set of values of the fundamental physical constants and closely related conversion factors for use worldwide. The first such CODATA set was published in 1973.

Later versions are named based on the year of the data incorporated; the 1986 CODATA (published April 1987) used data up to 1 January 1986. All subsequent releases use data up to the end of the stated year, and are necessarily published a year or two later: 1998 (April 2000),2002 (January 2005),2006 (June 2008)and the sixth in 2010 (November 2012). The latest version is Version 7. 0 called "2014 CODATA" published on 25 June 2015.

The CODATA recommended values of fundamental physical constants are published at the NIST Reference on Constants, Units, and Uncertainty. Since 1998, the task group has produced a new version every four years, incorporating results published up to the end of the specified year. In order to support the upcoming redefinition of the SI base units,adopted at the 26th General Conference on Weights and Measures on 16 November 2018, CODATA made a special release that was published in October 2017. It incorporates all data up to 1 July 2017,:4,67and determines the final numerical values of h, e, k, and N that are to be used for the new SI definitions.

The next regular version, with a closing date of 31 December 2018,will be used to produce the new 2018 CODATA values that will be made available by the time the revised SI come into force on 20 May 2019. This is necessary because the redefinitions have a significant (mostly beneficial) effect on the uncertainties and correlation coefficients reported by CODATA. • None International Bureau of Weights and Measures (2019-05-20), SI Brochure: The International System of Units (SI) (9th ed. ), ISBN • None International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) (2017-08-10).
